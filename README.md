# Self-Balancing Robot Simulation with Gazebo and ROS2

## Overview

Welcome to the Self-Balancing Robot Simulation project! This project aims to simulate a self-balancing robot using Gazebo and ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2). The robot is designed with two wheels and a rectangular body, equipped with an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor to maintain balance. The simulation environment includes obstacles to provide a realistic testing ground.

## Project Objectives

- **Robot Modeling**: Create a robot model with two wheels and a rectangular body using URDF/Xacro files.
- **Sensor Integration**: Incorporate an IMU sensor to provide orientation and angular velocity data.
- **Simulation Environment**: Develop a Gazebo world populated with obstacles.
- **ROS2 and Gazebo Integration**: Establish communication bridges between ROS2 and Gazebo to access sensor data and control the robot.
- **Control Algorithms**: Implement control laws (e.g., PID controller) in ROS2 nodes to enable self-balancing.
- **Advanced Control Methods**: Explore more complex control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC), state-space control, or reinforcement learning.
- **Docker Containerization**: Package the entire simulation into a Docker container for easy setup and replication.
- **Documentation and Sharing**: Provide detailed documentation and create a YouTube video explaining the project.

## Features

- **Custom Robot Model**: A two-wheeled robot with a realistic physical model.
- **Interactive Simulation**: A Gazebo world with obstacles to challenge the robot.
- **Real-Time Sensor Data**: Access to IMU data for precise control.
- **ROS2 Control Nodes**: Nodes that implement the control laws for self-balancing.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Easy deployment and consistency across different systems.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Guides and configuration files for testing and tuning.

## Skills

- **Robotics Simulation**: Hands-on experience with Gazebo and ROS2.
- **Control Systems**: Understanding and implementing control laws.
- **Software Integration**: Bridging different software tools and environments.
- **Docker Usage**: Containerizing applications for development and deployment.
- **Technical Documentation**: Writing clear guides and explanations.
- **Communication**: Explaining complex concepts through video and written content.
